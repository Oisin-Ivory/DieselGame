## DieselGame
*This is a repository for my FPS Arena Survival Game.*

Diesel is based on games such as Quake and Dusk. All the models and textures were created by me using Maya, Photoshop and Blender.
Sounds were gotten from various users from freesound.org. The music in the game is by Kevin MacLeod.

#Objective
The objective of this game is to survive for as long as possible against enemy robots. As the game goes on, more enemies spawn.
You must manage your health and ammo to survive, while there are pickups around the map they are finite, however robots will drop resources too.
